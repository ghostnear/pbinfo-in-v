# PBInfo in V

This repository contains several problems from the Romanian coding website [pbinfo.ro](https://www.pbinfo.ro/).

I made those in V as practice to understand the language.

## How to see which source is for which problem

You need to access the page for the specific id using:

https://www.pbinfo.ro/probleme/(id)/

IF you actually want to understand what it says, you might want to translate the page.
